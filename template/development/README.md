# development/ — repo process memory

Everything agents and developers need to work on this repo: conventions,
decisions, and the per-feature work-document lifecycle. This tree is
**repo-internal** — never published, never linked from a documentation site.
User-facing documentation, if the project has any, lives in `docs/` (kept for
that purpose alone, the way `src/` is kept for sources) and is written for
readers, not rewritten from these files mechanically.

| File / folder | What |
| --- | --- |
| [`harness-usage.md`](harness-usage.md) | how to drive the agent harness (Claude Code & OpenCode): phases, subagents, hooks, document liveness |
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | orientation: system structure, boundaries, invariants |
| [`style.md`](style.md) | code style, comments, commit messages, changelog |
| [`glossary.md`](glossary.md) | the project's ubiquitous language: domain terms used in specs, code, and conversation |
| [`testing.md`](testing.md) | test layering, gate commands, gate-output reading rules |
| [`tool-bootstrap.md`](tool-bootstrap.md) | toolchain install and new-machine setup |
| [`adr/`](adr/) | architecture decision records (append-only) + the decision register |
| `work/<YYYY-MM>-<slug>/` | one folder per feature: `spec.md` / `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / `report.md` (+ gitignored `scratch.md`) |

These documents are living but **trunk-gated**: agents follow them and
propose changes via a dedicated PR or a decision-register row
([`adr/README.md`](adr/README.md)) — never by silently editing them in the
middle of a feature. Which files freeze, and when:
[`harness-usage.md`](harness-usage.md#document-liveness).
