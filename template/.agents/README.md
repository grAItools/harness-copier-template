# Agent harness

This directory holds the **cross-tool** agent definitions — `subagents/`,
`commands/`, and `skills/` — that are symlinked into each tool's own directory
(`.claude/`, `.opencode/`) so they are defined once and read by all. `hooks/`
holds shared hook scripts (see the deny-list note below).

The governing rule: **root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) is the single source of
truth for agent instructions. Wire every agent to it by reference — never
duplicate content.** Each agent has its own convention for where it looks for
project-level instructions; copying the same guidance into a Claude file, a
Gemini file, a Cursor file, and so on makes the copies drift. Pointing every
agent back at one file prevents that structurally.

## Adding an agent

1. **Reads root `AGENTS.md` natively?** Do nothing but add a row above.
2. **Reads a plain-markdown file at a fixed path (no required frontmatter)?**
   Symlink it to `AGENTS.md` with a relative target, like the existing symlinks:
   ```sh
   # examples for rules-directory agents
   ln -s ../AGENTS.md    .clinerules/AGENTS.md
   ln -s ../../AGENTS.md .continue/rules/AGENTS.md
   ```
3. **Needs a config key or a frontmatter'd file?** Add a thin pointer/config stub
   that references `AGENTS.md`. Never copy instruction prose into it. Precedent:
   ```jsonc
   // .gemini/settings.json
   { "context": { "fileName": ["AGENTS.md", "GEMINI.md"] } }
   ```
4. Put tool-specific guidance (not meant for every agent) in that tool's own file,
   not in `AGENTS.md`.

## Layout

Everything here is a single source read by both tools. The symlinks are
created by the post-generation hook; if you copy this layout manually,
recreate them with:

```sh
ln -s ../.agents/subagents .claude/agents    && ln -s ../.agents/subagents .opencode/agents
ln -s ../.agents/commands  .claude/commands  && ln -s ../.agents/commands  .opencode/commands
ln -s ../.agents/skills    .claude/skills    && ln -s ../.agents/skills    .opencode/skills
```

### `subagents/`

One Markdown file per role, with YAML frontmatter. Supported keys:

- `name` (required) — invocation name; identity comes from this, not the
  filename.
- `description` (required) — used by parent agents to decide when to
  delegate; start with "Use proactively when…" for auto-discovery.
- `model` (optional) — `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku` / `inherit`.
- `tools` (optional) — Claude Code allowlist, comma-separated names
  (e.g. `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`). Claude Code only.
- `permission` (optional) — OpenCode per-action map with keys
  `read` / `write` / `edit` / `bash`, each taking `allow` / `ask` / `deny`;
  `bash` can also be a per-pattern map (e.g. `"rg *": allow`, `"*": deny`).
  OpenCode only — Claude Code ignores this field.
- `mode` (optional, **strongly recommended for subagents**) — OpenCode-only.
  Set `mode: subagent` to keep the agent delegation-only; the default
  (`all`) would also expose it as a top-level primary OpenCode agent.

A subagent runs in its own context window — use them to keep heavy
exploration or repetitive review out of the main session's context. Claude
Code subagents **cannot spawn other subagents**: when a role needs something
run outside itself (an `explorer` pass, a spike experiment, a user's
answer), it stops and hands back to the main agent, carrying the request
and the resume instruction in its own reply — the role subagents' Handoff
sections define these protocols. The reply must be self-contained because a
subagent can be reached by description match as well as by its slash
command, and in the former case the command's instructions were never
loaded.

### `commands/`

One Markdown file per slash command, with YAML frontmatter (`description`,
optional `argument-hint`). Keep each command short and imperative — the
description is what surfaces in the slash-command picker, and the body is
the prompt the agent will follow.

### `skills/`

One directory per skill, containing a `SKILL.md` (required, with YAML
frontmatter `name` and `description`) and optionally `scripts/`
(deterministic executables), `references/` (docs loaded on demand), and
`assets/`. `design-principles/` is the skill that ships — the shared design
ground rules and red-flag checklist the role subagents read. Write skill
descriptions slightly "pushy" — agents tend to under-trigger skills —
and include synonyms.

## Caveats

- **Copier-managed.** This harness is generated from a Copier template
  (`gh:grAItools/harness-copier-template`; see `.copier-answers.yml`). Edits to
  template-owned files (`.claude/settings.json`, `.opencode/opencode.jsonc`,
  `AGENTS.md`, the managed `.gitignore` block) can be reverted by `copier update`;
  port durable changes upstream behind a per-agent toggle. Net-new files (this
  README, `.agents/hooks/*`, `.gemini/settings.json`) are safe.
- **Symlinks need `core.symlinks=true`.** On Windows checkouts without it, Git
  materializes a symlink as a text file containing the target path; prefer a stub
  there. The repo already relies on symlinks for `.claude/` / `.opencode/`.
- **Destructive-command deny-list** is canonical in
  [`hooks/block-destructive.sh`](hooks/block-destructive.sh); OpenCode's deny globs
  are a hand-kept mirror (it cannot call a script).
- **Hook payload parsing** is canonical in
  [`hooks/hook-input.sh`](hooks/hook-input.sh): the Claude Code hooks in
  `.claude/settings.json` read their JSON input through it (`jq`, with a
  `python3` fallback; each backend is probed by *running* it, so a `jq` that
  resolves but cannot run falls through instead of failing the read). With
  neither parser working, the PreToolUse guard fails closed with an
  explanatory message, SessionStart warns, and the Stop gate still runs but
  can only report a red result. Read scalar string or boolean fields: the
  backends agree on those, not on number spelling (see the script header).
